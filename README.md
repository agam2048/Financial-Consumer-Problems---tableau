# Financial-Consumer-Problems---tableau

Problem Statement -  The dataset “Financial Consumer Problems” tells us about the various financial problems faced by consumers in USA. Some common problems are closing your account, managing accounts, trouble during payment processes ang many more.
So our project shows how problems were originated, disputes were solved or not etc.



I have made the project on Financial Consumer Complaints. In this, we used this dataset which was maintained by Mark Bradbourne which is published on data.world website by him. 
I used this data to find out how many complaints were registered for a particular interval of time, what was the time of response to their complaints, how many of them are in progress, what is the disputed rate, how many were resolved with extra cost or no cost.
I also used different visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, Hexmap etc to find out the complaints on the basis of states, issue, media, product and consumer percentage disputed which can be very useful to know the factors which needs the work most. 
In this dataset fields such as product, sub product, company, state, zip code, consumer satisfaction etc were used all together to form different sheets in tableau.

Conclusion and Future Scope –

Hence to conclude the project deals with the financial problems faced by consumer in The USA. The tableau project gives a better understanding of many aspects vividly with the help of various representation such as bar graph, pie charts, box plots, scatter plot, hexmap and many more.
